My very first non-clone game project. I have developed this using Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint system during my internship program. My main goals were understanding UE4 basics and game development process. I have implemented various mechanics that were asked from me and some additional ones that I designed.  

```markdown
- Basic character movement
- Ladder movement
- Wall climbing
- Object interaction
- Teleportation
- Hook
- Quest system
- Dialogue system
- Basic AI
- Drawing and casting various spells with mouse  
movement -which I enjoyed most-
```

At the end of the project, I learned the following well.  

```markdown
- How things work in UE4
- UE4 Blueprint System
- Blueprint Interfaces
- Debugging
- OOP in UE4
- Basic UI
- Event dispatchers
- Basic optimization in blueprints
- Tracing and other musts.
```

My second project during my internship program was turn based strategy game. This time, my main goal was understanding multiplayer game systems in UE4. I also learned how to set up a dedicated server for the game I developed.  

```markdown
- Different troop and building types
- Turn based system
- Grid based map
- Path finding for troops
- Fog of war
- Details panel for every interactable object
```

At the end of the project, I learned this following concepts.  

```markdown
- How things work in a multiplayer game
- Server-client relation
- Construction script
- More optimization
- Building dedicated server
```
